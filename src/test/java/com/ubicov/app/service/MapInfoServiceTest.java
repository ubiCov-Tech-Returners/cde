 * Very light weight thin test.  This test needs to be expanded depending on
 * service functionality.  Here we are only testing the fetch as this set of data
 * has been manually captured and will NOT need to be changed.
 * <p>
 * Due to time restraints the tests here are limited but what has been achieved should give
 * a good indication on what could be done in the future.
 * <p>
 * This class test the non-persisted map information which needs to be in the 'GeoJson' format.
